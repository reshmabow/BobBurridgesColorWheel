# Bob Burridges Color Wheel

## What is this?
There is an excellent tool for choosing colors for a painting, invented and kindly shared by Bob Burridge.
You should probably go out and buy his wheel from his website.
What I wanted to do was to create a digital version of it that I could use to pick colors, but also as a tool that could be used in other processing sketches.


##How do you use it?
When you run the sketch you will see the color wheel on the left and a thumbnail of the color pallette on the right.
The color wheel shows three "paddles" around the circle. Thes represent the base color, focal color and the two spice colors.
You can get different color schemes by pressing "," to rotate paddles left and "." to rotate paddles right.
